# python-assistant

The provided Python script integrates several libraries and web technologies to create a voice-controlled virtual assistant. The assistant is designed to execute various tasks based on user voice commands. The script encompasses functionalities such as weather information retrieval, application launching, YouTube music playback, website opening, and interaction with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for natural language processing.

The script starts by importing necessary libraries, including speech_recognition for voice recognition, selenium for web automation, pyautogui for GUI automation, pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, and openai for language processing.

Key components are initialized, including the speech recognition object, the text-to-speech engine, and the OpenAI API key. User feedback is managed through functions like user_feedback, and conversations are logged in a text file using append_to_history.

Specific functionalities include weather information retrieval using Selenium to interact with an AccuWeather website, opening applications specified by the user, playing music from YouTube, and opening websites. The script also interacts with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for generating responses based on user prompts.

Voice commands are verified using the verify function, which identifies the type of command based on the user's input. The input_audio function captures voice input using a microphone, and the commands function interprets specific actions such as stopping the assistant, pausing, setting timers, adjusting volume, or checking the current time.

The main loop continuously captures voice input, processes commands, and interacts with the assistant's functionalities based on user prompts. The script provides a dynamic and interactive voice-controlled assistant, offering a range of functionalities to the user.
